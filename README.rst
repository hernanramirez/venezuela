========================
django-twoscoops-project
========================

A project template for Django 1.6 (with a tag for Django 1.5).

To use this project follow these steps:

#. Create your working environment
#. Install Django
#. Create the new project using the django-two-scoops template
#. Install additional dependencies

*note: these instructions show creation of a project called "icecream".  You
should replace this name with the actual name of your project.*

What about Django 1.7 (or higher)?
==================================

This project is meant to be paired with the Two Scoops of Django, which stop at 1.6. Since this is the case, we won't be upgrading this project for upcoming releases of Django.

If you are looking for cutting edge Django templates, we recommend:

* https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django
* https://github.com/luzfcb/cookiecutter-django-oauth

These (and many others) are powered by cookiecutter_, which is an awesome tool by Audrey Roy, who happens to be one of the co-authors of Two Scoops of Django.

Working Environment
===================

You have several options in setting up your working environment.  We recommend
using virtualenv to separate the dependencies of your project from your system's
python environment.  If on Linux or Mac OS X, you can also use virtualenvwrapper to help manage multiple virtualenvs across different projects.

Virtualenv Only
---------------

First, make sure you are using virtualenv (http://www.virtualenv.org). Once
that's installed, create your virtualenv::

    $ virtualenv icecream

You will also need to ensure that the virtualenv has the project directory
added to the path. Adding the project directory will allow `django-admin.py` to
be able to change settings using the `--settings` flag.

Virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper
------------------------------------

In Linux and Mac OSX, you can install virtualenvwrapper (http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/),
which will take care of managing your virtual environments and adding the
project path to the `site-directory` for you::

    $ mkdir icecream
    $ mkvirtualenv -a icecream icecream-dev
    $ cd icecream && add2virtualenv `pwd`

Using virtualenvwrapper with Windows
----------------------------------------

There is a special version of virtualenvwrapper for use with Windows (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper-win).::

    > mkdir icecream
    > mkvirtualenv icecream-dev
    > add2virtualenv icecream


Installing Django
=================

To install Django in the new virtual environment, run the following command::

    $ pip install django

Creating your project
=====================

To create a new Django project called '**icecream**' using
django-twoscoops-project, run the following command::

    $ django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/twoscoops/django-twoscoops-project/archive/master.zip --extension=py,rst,html icecream_project

For Django 1.5 users, we recommend::

    $ django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/twoscoops/django-twoscoops-project/archive/1.5.zip --extension=py,rst,html icecream_project

Installation of Dependencies
=============================

Depending on where you are installing dependencies:

In development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

For production::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

*note: We install production requirements this way because many Platforms as a
Services expect a requirements.txt file in the root of projects.*
